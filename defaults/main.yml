# The credentials for the S3 bucket
s3cmd:
  key: ''
  secret: ''
  user: 'root'
  path: ''

# User
# The user that should own the config file

# Path
# If this is empty the config file will go into the user's home directory
# Set a path if you want the s3cmd config file put into a different path.
# ie. when the s3cmd.user is a system user with no home folder
# eg. s3cmd_config_path: "/etc/asterisk"
